# C - Search Algorithms

In this project on search algorithms, I implemented various search algorithms and analyzed their space and time complexities. This allowed me to gain insights into the efficiency of different search strategies, including linear search and binary search. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of search algorithms and their practical applications.

# Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

# 0. Linear search

  + <u>[0-linear.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/0-linear.c)</u>: C function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.

  + If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1.

# 1. Binary search
 
  + <u>[1-binary.c](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/1-binary.c)</u>: C function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.

  + If value is not present in array or if array is NULL.

	+ Otherwise function must return -1.

# 2. Big O #0

  + <u>[2-O](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/2-O)</u>: Time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n.
