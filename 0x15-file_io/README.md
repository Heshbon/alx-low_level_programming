# C - File I/O.

This project focuses on understanding and implementing file input and output operations in C programming, using system calls and file descriptors. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of handling files, including creating, opening, closing, reading, and writing files. The project emphasizes practical skills in using standard I/O functions and system calls in a Unix/Linux environment.
